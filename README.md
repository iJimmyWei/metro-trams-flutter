# Manchester Metro Trams App

Manchester Metro Trams is built using Flutter to show the next upcoming trams from your chosen station. It's currently released on Android ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jimmywei.metro_trams](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jimmywei.metro_trams)).

No plans are to release for iOS unless there is a demand to.

# Getting Started
1. Setup your API Key with an `.env` file in the root directory, i.e `API_KEY=abcdefg12345` - you will need to create an account at TfGM ([https://developer.tfgm.com/](https://developer.tfgm.com/)) and apply for an API key.
2. Create a `key.properties` file at the `android/` root directory containing your keystore file to allow debugging (`android/key.properties`)
3. Hit F5/Debug and watch the app run!
